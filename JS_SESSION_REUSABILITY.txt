Reusability In JS

What is reusability
	Reusability is one of the great promises of object-oriented technology.
	its all about writing a concised, modular part of the code to achieve a specific functionality.
	
	
Advantages:
	- write once, call multiple times
	- less code n hence saves times
	- modular approach

Disadvantage

Implementation:
	- Following are the few appraches we can think of in reusing the code in JS.


functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
function can be invoked whenever necessary in our js file.
eg.
function addNumbers(a,b){ return (a+b); }

Invocation : addNumbers(3,2);

Object Oriented Concept: Wrap your methods inside a object and invoke the methods as ObjectName.methodName();
eg : //student.js
	var Student ={
		getAllStudentsData : function(){
								// code goes here
						},
						
		getTotalMarks : function(){
				// some stuff goes here for adding all the marks
		}

	};
	
	//collegeDetails.js
		Student.getAllStudentsData();
		

	
	
	
	


Create a jQuery pluggin Sometimes you want to make a piece of functionality available throughout your code. For example, perhaps you want a single method you can call on a jQuery selection that performs a series of operations on the selection. In this case, you may want to write a plugin.

example:

$.fn :  It allows you to extend jQuery with your own functions

$.fn.blueBorder = function(){
 this.each(function(){
  $(this).css("border","solid blue 2px");
 });
 return this;
};
$.fn.blueText = function(){
 this.each(function(){
  $(this).css("color","blue");
 });
 return this;
};
and now you can actually invoke this method on any of the selectoe like : $('.blue').blueBorder().blueText(); (chaining)
